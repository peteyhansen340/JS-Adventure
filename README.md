# Overview


{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the JavaScript language.}

I have created a program a simple JavaScript program called Adventure. This program has the journey of the user stuctured into nodes and each choice from the user leads to other nodes depending on the input. There is a function handleChoice which recursively handles navigating through the story.    

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

I created this project to test and help me grow my understanding in using the JavaScript language. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

Node.js: This JavaScript runtime environment allows JavaScript to run server-side, enabling the creation of command-line applications like this one. It provides a 
platform to use JavaScript beyond web browsers.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

JavaScript: The core programming language used for this project. JavaScript is versatile, well-suited for building both front-end and back-end applications, and, in this case, powers the logic for an interactive text-based adventure game. Its flexibility allows the development of non-web applications like command-line tools.

readline Module: A built-in Node.js library used to handle input and output in a terminal-based environment. This library was key for capturing user choices and providing real-time responses within the interactive game.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Item 1 - fix the invalid input handling to account for more than just numbers 
- Item 2 An improvement would be a storyline expansion with adding to the story but also adding in things like inventory to allow the user to add and use items
- Item 3 Adding a timer for decisions to make this more interesting
